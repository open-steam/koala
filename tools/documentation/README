koaLA - co-active learning and working
======================================


Requirements:
============

* Apache webserver (apache2 or newer)
* Apache modules: "php5", "rewrite", "expires", "ssl"
* Apache module "ssl" if you want to support https connections
* PHP modules "gettext", "curl", "gc", "mysql", "ldap", "xmlrpc?" "pear"

optional:
	phpcli


Setup:
======

1) Place etc/httpd/koala.conf in /etc/apache2/sites-available (on Debian Linux,
   this may be different depending on your distribution/system), adapt the
   configuration file to your server and directory structure, enable the site
   (on Debian Linux) and restart apache

2) If you want to support SSL connections (HTTPS): 
   create SSL Certificates (if you dont already have them. Refer to etc/httpd/koala.conf for more information):
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out koala-passwd.key 1024
   openssl rsa -in koala-passwd.key -out koala.key
   openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 1100 -key koala.key -out koala.crt
   then copy the certificated into the ssl config directory
   mv koala.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
   mv koala.key /etc/ssl/private/
   then edit
   /etc/apache2/listen.conf and insert "Listen 443". Then restart apache.

3) Edit your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf (or httpd.conf, depending on your
   system) and remove (or comment out) the following line:
   * Alias /icons/ "/usr/share/apache2/icons/"
   and the corresponding directory section.

3) Edit your php.ini:
   * set magic_quotes_gpc = Off
   * upload_max_filesize and post_max_size should be set to the maximum
     file size you want to allow for up- and downloads (e.g. 50M).
   * memory_limit should be set to a large enough value to support your
     file size limit (e.g. >= 55M in case of 20M file size allowed).
   * max_execution_time and max_input_time should be set to a large enough
     value to support your up- and downloads (e.g. 60 seconds).

Then either call "php setup.php" or adjust the configs by hand.
If you use the setup script, you can skip the following steps as the script
will ask you for the necessary setup options and perform those steps for you.
You can also use the setup script to check your config at a later date. If
new setup options have become available in the meantime (in the config file
templates), then the script will notify you of this and offer to update the
config files for you.

5) Make sure the log-files in log/error.log and log/messages.log are writable

6) Make sure that the cache directory is writable to store the cache files.

7) Copy etc/koala.def.php.example to etc/koala.def.php and adapt it to your
   needs (directory structure, web server structure, etc.).
   Also make sure it is readable by your webserver (e.g. world-readable).

8) Copy public/.htaccess.example to public/.htaccess and adapt it (make sure
   that the paths are correct).

9) Create the required structures on your open-sTeam backend:
   * Group "Faculties" where group "sTeam" has read permission
   * Subgroups of "Faculties" with some Groups named with the departments of
     your organization (these will be selectable in user profile). These groups
     must have "free entry" enabled which means everybody is able to join them.
   * Group "Courses" where group "sTeam" has read permission
   * Group "PublicGroups", where group "sTeam" has read and insert permission
     (and the same permission on the group's workroom)
   * Group "PrivGroups" where group "sTeam" has read and insert permission
     (this group usually already exists on open-sTeam servers by default)
   * Group "Courses/<your-current-koaLA-semester>" where "sTeam" has read
     permission
   * Group "Courses/<your-current-koaLA-semester>/admins" where "sTeam" has
     read permission
   * set read and insert permission on Group
     "Courses/<your-current-koaLA-semester>" for the "admins" group you created
     in that semester
   * Container /config/koala
   * Container /config/koala/extensions
   * Optional: If you want to use Synchronization with the PAUL System, log in
     as root with activated documents extension, then create a folder named
     "paulsync" in roots "MyDocuments" (/home/root/documents/paulsync)
10) Install the open-sTeam SPM package "koala_support" from
    http://steamware.open-steam.org/Packages/koala_support/download/
    (You can go to the /packages folder in your open-sTeam webinterface and
    upload and install the package there.)


Common Problems:
================

* "Invalid command: ExpiresActive" -> activate the "expires" module in your Apache web server
