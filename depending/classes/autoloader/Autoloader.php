/**
 * Registers an Autoloader
 *
 * The Autoloader works out of the box as simple as possible. You have
 * nothing more to do than require this file. Don't bother the time it
 * consumes when it's called the first time. Let it build its index.
 * The second time it will run as fast as light.
 *
 * The simplest and probably most common use case shows this example:
 *
 * index.php
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * require dirname(__FILE__) . "/autoloader/Autoloader.php";
 * $myObject = new MyClass();
 * </code>
 * 
 * classes/MyClass.php
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * class MyClass extends MyParentClass
 * {
 *
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * classes/MyParentClass.php
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * class MyParentClass
 * {
 *
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * As you can see it's only necessary to require this file once.
 * If this is done in the document root of your classes (index.php in
 * this case) the Autoloader is already configured. After requiring
 * this file you don't have to worry where your classes reside.
 *
 * Another use case would have the class path outside of your document root.
 * As the autoloader has no knowledge of this arbitrary path you have to
 * tell him where your class path is:
 *
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * require dirname(__FILE__) . "/autoloader/Autoloader.php";
 *
 * // As the guessed class path is wrong you should remove this Autoloader.
 * Autoloader::getRegisteredAutoloader()->remove();
 *
 * // register your arbitrary class path
 * $autoloader = new Autoloader($classpath);
 * $autoloader->register();
 *
 * // You might also have other class paths
 * $autoloader2 = new Autoloader($classpath2);
 * $autoloader2->register();
 * </code>
 *
 * If you have the possibility to enable PHP's tokenizer you should do
 * this. Otherwise the Autoloader has to use a parser based on PCRE
 * which is not as reliable as PHP's tokenizer.
 *
 * The Autoloader assumes that a class name is unique. If you have classes with
 * equal names the behaviour is undefined.
