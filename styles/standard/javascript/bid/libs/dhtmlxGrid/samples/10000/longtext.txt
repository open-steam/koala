The first inhabitants of the Czech lands were prehistoric fish Thats because the country at the time was covered by a prehistoric ocean  thanks to which it is possible to find some very nice fossils of trilobytes in the Czech Republic today 
Todays Czech Republic was later populated by dinosaurs of all sorts and later by neanderthals and even by mammoths The prehistoric settlement of the presentday Czech Republic by people culminated in the fourth century BC with the arrival of the Celts the first modern human inhabitants of this territory that we know of In fact the Latin name for the Czech lands Boiohaemum Bohemia is derived from the name of the Boii Celtic tribe; and the Czech name for the Moldau River which flows through the capital city of Prague is Vltava  which is said to come from the Celtic Vlt meaning wild and Va meaning water 
The Czech Celts were in part chased out of the region and in part assimilated by the next peoples to inhabit the area: the Germanic Marcomanni and Quadi tribes from the west and the Romans from the south The Romans didnt actually occupy Czech territory  they only got as far north as the Danube River which flows from Germany  through Austria along its border with Slovakia  and then over to Hungary before continuing on to Yugoslavia and so just misses the Czech lands During the Migration of Peoples  roughly from the d to the th centuries AD  Slav colonization spread westward from the Steppes of the East probably from Panonia all the way to the territory of the presentday Czech Republic and up to Poland and down again to Yugoslavia From probably the sixth century AD on the Slavic peoples settled in several waves of migration into the regions which had been conveniently abandoned by the Germanic tribes 
This is the way that it all came to be  according to popular Czech legend: Once upon a time there were three brothers: Czech Lech and Rus One day they decided to find a new place to live and so they and their tribes set out on a journey They got as far as the Dnieper River when Rus said This is the place for me and my tribe! and there the Russians stayed Czech who is known as Praotec Cech or Ancestor Czech in these parts  and Lech continued Soon they came upon a rich land overflowing with milk and honey and Czech climbed to the top of Rip hill in Bohemia and decided that this was the place for him and for his tribe Lech and his people continued their journey and settled in presentday Poland Other versions of the legend have  brothers in all with the addition of other Slav nations like the Croats who have a similar legend about  wandering brothers and some others whose names are not remembered anymore One modern interpretation of the story has the Czechs spending some time in Greece before finally heading north and settling and this would actually conveniently explain the similarities between certain Czech legends like that of Bruncviks odyssey or of Sarka and her band of women warriors with Greek ones 
Czech legend goes on to say that Cechs people were happy in the Czech lands and after a few generations and some time had passed the Slavs of Bohemia had a new leader  a guy by the name of Krok who lived at Vysehrad which means high castle and is today the site of the Czech National Cemetery Probably the most important thing about Krok were his three very beautiful daughters who were named Kazi Teta and Libuse The last of these Libuse had special powers which allowed her to see the future Kazi the oldest was a healer who knew the secrets of the plants and herbs while Teta was high priestess 
Libuses talent came in particularly handy when it came time for her to marry According to legend she inherited rule over the Czech tribes from her father Krok As ruler of the lands she was also the highest court of appeal for disputes among the people It is said that a guy who did not like one of her decisions as judge started a stink about the fact that the Czechs were ruled by a woman And so Libuse had a vision  and sent her white horse accompanied by a group of her subjects  to go out and find a guy ploughing in his field After a journey of some days the horse and the humans did indeed come upon just such a man and nobody seemed surprised at all at this  neither the humans nor the horse nor even the man himself and Przemysl Ploughman Premysl Orac in Czech came to Vysehrad and married Libuse and took over the job of ruling the unruly Czechs and he and Libuse together started the Przemyslid Dynasty which ruled over the Czech lands till the th century  
One day not long after the wedding Libuse had a vision in which she foretold of the glory of the Czech capital Standing atop Vysehrad hill she went into a trance and told her vision to the people even as the gods sent it to her She said that on the seven hills of Prague a fair city would grow the fame of which would rise to the very stars And all that she saw and all of which she foretold really came true Of course! 
No while Cech and Libuse are the stuff of imaginative Czech legend it is believed that Samo  who may or may not have ruled this part of the world in the first half of the seventh century AD  was probably a real person Its hard to tell though since nobody is sure of minor details like where Samo was from where Samo lived or where Samo ruled  if that is he existed at all If he did he is thought to have been a Frankish merchant who placed himself on the side of the Slavs against the wicked Avar tribes of Hungary He is mentioned in early chronicles where his address is given as Wogastisburg Fortress Nobody today knows where this Wogastisburg Fortress was  but its believed by Czechs to have stood on Rubin hill in Bohemia 
Wherever Samos home base really was his rule seems to represent the first successful attempt at uniting the Slavic tribes  and since the Slavs are not exactly known for their brotherly love for one another then again who in Europe is? this was quite a feat The reason for this unification under Samo was predictably quite pragmatic The Slavic tribes cooperated in order to withstand attacks by the Avars a powerful Asian tribe whose home was on the plains of Hungary 
At some point Charlemagne joined in the battle against the Avars in this part of the world cooperating either with Samo or with the state structure that came after him  the Great Moravian Empire 
Again reports on the Great Moravian Empire are fuzzy According to period chronicles the people living along the Morava River at the time were already known as Moravians and their shortlived empire existed somewhere between todays Slovakia and Germany and Poland and Austria that is somewhere in todays Czech Republic in the th and/or th century Just like Wogastisburg Fortress its claimed to have stood in different places by all the people who live in those different places 
At some time during the ninth century Greater Moravia was ruled by the Moravian prince Svatopluk and had grown to include todays South Moravia the southernmost bits of presentday Poland and Silesia the western part of Hungary and for a short time the whole of Bohemia Perhaps the most important thing about the Great Moravians is that theirs was the first legal sort of state structure in the area to accept Christianity and the cultural development of the Greater Moravian Empire is inseparably linked to the spread of the eastern Byzantine liturgy of Sts Cyril and Methodius who came to these parts in  They were invited by the Moravians  who were interested in Christianity but couldnt understand the language in which it was preached at the time Cyril and Methodius were chosen for the mission because they understood and were able to speak in the Slavic tongue again lending weight to the theory that the Slavs of these parts had not long before been spending some time in Greece 
Some buildings from around about this time still stand  mostly Romanesque basilicas like the one on Rip Hill the very hill that GreatGranddad Czech liked so much! at Vysehrad in Pragues Old Town and at other places It was Cyril and Methodius too who brought the written word to the region the Cyrillic alphabet is named for Cyril even though his real name was not Cyril but Constantine  The beginning of a written Slavic language was to be of enormous importance to Slavic nations in the Middle Ages On the downside the introduction of Christianity to this territory was so overwhelmingly successful that we know very little today about the preChristian religion of the pagan Slavs 
Greater Moravian Empire disintegrated thanks to the Hungarian invasion of  or  and political intrigue in the early days of the Holy Roman Empire After that the Slavic mission in Moravia  which had been established by the missionaries Cyril and Methodius  collapsed and the population reverted to tribal conditions The Christian heritage of the Greater Moravian Empire however was to be preserved with the ascent of the Przemyslid dynasty to the throne of Bohemia 

With the Great Moravian Empire out of the way the Przemyslid family succeeded in laying the foundations of a Czech state somewhere around the the end of the ninth century They did this mostly by ridding themselves of all of the things that were standing in their way like the Vrsovic and Slavnik clans  which the Przemyslids murdered in a particularly bloody manner  The only Vrsovec to escape the massacre of his family was Adalbert but it didnt do him much good Adalbert was so thankful for his salvation that he became a Christian missionary and headed northwest to the area of todays northeast Germany to spread the Word No sooner did he arrive at his destination than he was brutally roasted and eaten by the inhabitants Adalbert or Vojtech as he is known in Czech is another of the Czech nations patron saints today 
 

But Vojtech was not the only early Czech guy to be made a saint thanks to the Przemyslids bloodthirstiness On the contrary  the Przemyslid rulers were rather a mixed bag and when they ran out of rival clans to murder they started murdering each other  resulting in some more early saints for the Czechs 

Wenceslas I the fourth Przemyslid Czech ruler was made a saint soon after his murder in 929 or 935 This Wenceslas in Czech Vaclav is the Good King Wenceslas of the Christmas carol and it was during his reign that the Czech lands entered into an alliance with Saxony thereby laying the foundations for closer relations with the restored Roman Empire 

This mischievous affability on Wenceslas part towards the Czechs western neighbors is a main reason that he was killed by his brother who wasnt very good in fact he is known as Boleslav the Cruel Another reason might be that Boleslav was a pagan and he felt that Wenceslas was frittering away too much time with this new Christian fashion hed picked up  though lust for power probably also played a role in Boleslavs motive for the murder which took place at the very door of the church in Stara Boleslav where Wenceslas was trying to seek refuge 

Incidentally Boleslav and Wenceslas Grandmother on their fathers side was also murdered and also made a saint It is said that she was either smothered to death with a pillow or choked to death  this time the killer was her daughterinlaw Boleslav and Wenceslas mother and the motive was again power Drahomira wanted to place Wenceslas on the throne 

Things didnt get much better within the Przemyslid family it is suspected that  Interestingly enough the Przemyslids are remembered rather fondly in the Czech Republic today as it seems that most people are blissfully unaware of the familys murderous streak 

Maybe that is because the Przemyslids occasionally took time off from their favorite sport to increase Bohemias power and prestige In typical early feudal fashion this meant that they went out killing people in other countries instead expanding their empire to Moravia and Silesia as well as the upper reaches of the river Vistula and parts of western Slovakia In Moravia they set up a system of dukedoms with the office of Margrave ruler of Moravia sometimes being held by the Bohemian Dauphin sometimes by a rival for the Bohemian throne In this way the Przemyslide dynastic killings were stayed and both Bohemia and Moravia came to be regarded as hereditary lands of the Przemyslid dynasty All the while the expansion of the Przemyslid Dynastys power went hand in hand with the spread of Christianity in the region 

 This growing Przemyslide state maintained its sovereignty though it formally recognized the feudal supremacy of the RomanGerman Empire The Czech lands ranked among the most advanced of the European feudal states being at the forefront of economic power and cultural achievement at the time In keeping with this growing importance the territory was officially recognized through the granting of a royal crown to the Przemyslid Dynasty in the eleventh century it was made hereditary in 1212 by the Golden Sicilian Bull and the granting of the title of emperor for Czech rulers 

The 1100s and 1200s were a very busy time in this part of Europe and colonization trade and cultural activity were steadily on the increase Prague which lay smack dab in the middle of several continental trade routes flourished Pragues Old Town was founded in 1234 as the first of Pragues five towns and the Lesser Quarter was founded in 1257 Border forests were settled and towns and fortresses were founded and fortified These sweeping changes literally transformed the country and in keeping with these physical changes the social structure of the territory also evolved From about this time aristocrats burghers and serfs were to be spotted in the Czech lands  as were German settlers who were invited to colonize previously uninhabited mostly border regions of Bohemia and Moravia The German settlers whether burghers or peasants did not form a homogeneous or politically separate group and they soon became part of the local community identifying with Czech statehood and sharing in the development of the Czech and Moravian lands as fully enfranchised members of the population but mostly but keeping their native language in addition to learning Czech Many many many many centuries later the places that they settled would come to be known as the Sudetenland 

From the thirteenth century the Czech kingdom was one of the most robust states in all of Europe with a growing population and a vigorous economy This in turn made the Czech nobility and rulers all the more rich and powerful and enabled king Przemysl Otakar II to expand his territory rather extensively if briefly Otakar II was quite wellknown in his time and he even makes an appearance in Dantes Divine Comedy Otokar II also known as the King of Gold and Iron because of his considerable wealth and his considerable military might defeated the armies of the Hungarian king in 1256 and again in 1260 This military victory allowed him to annex the Alpine countries todays Austria and beyond  extending his territories all the way to the Adriatic Sea Some people claim that this brief period  in which Bohemia controlled territory bordering on the sea  is the basis for Shakespeares infamous Bohemian seacoast from his play The Tempest 

Well while the Czech lands were gaining power prestige oceanfront property and other things a powerful rival appeared in Germany in the person of the newlyelected ruler of the Holy Roman Empire Rudolf Habsburg  a member of a previously unimportant family from the Rhineland This Rudolf formed an alliance of German princes and  after the Czech King Przemysl Otakar II was killed in battle in Moravia against the combined Roman and Hungarian forces on August 26 1278  Rudolf took possession of the abovementioned Alpine lands which later became the basis of the Habsburgs power  ie Austria 

The late Czech King Przemysl Otakar II was succeeded by his son Wenceslas II 12781305 Under his reign the mining of Czech silver at Kutna Hora and the minting of the Czech silver groschen  one of the hardest European currencies of the time  flourished Wenceslas II also created a confederation between Bohemia and Poland For a short time Hungary  under the rule of Matthias Czak Trenciansky who held absolute rule over most of Slovakia as well  also joined this confederation 

The PolishCzech union was strengthened under the brief rule of Wenceslas III Had it survived it might have contributed to the creation of a more advanced region in Europe as the earlier Czech Austrian union had However this was precluded by the death of young Wenceslas III in 1306 when he was just 17 years old Wenceslas III was the last male member of the Przemyslids line and after his death the CzechPolish union fell apart


With the demise of Wenceslas III the last of the Przemyslid rulers of the Czech lands the difficult question of who should rule next had to be answered And answered it was  by 14yearold John of Luxembourg the first of the Luxembourgs to occupy the Czech throne 13101437 John of Luxembourg gained this position with the support of the Czech nobility by marrying 18yearold Eliska Przemyslova the sister of the late Wenceslas III 

Under John of Luxembourgs rule more territories  including the regions of Cheb Lusatia and Silesia  were joined to Bohemia All of these regions together under the rule of John of Luxembourg came to be known as the Lands of the Czech Crown So you see there never was an easy oneword way like Czechia to describe this part of the world not even in way back in the 14th century 

John of Luxembourg was a good king but he had a fatal weakness for chivalry knighthood honour  and especially for battles He loved to fight When there werent any battles in his immediate neighborhood he went abroad to help his friends fight their battles And so it happened that he fell at the battle of Crecy in 1346 fighting on the side of his French friend and distant relative Charles against the Black Prince And so he was succeeded by his young son Charles IV 

 Charles IV was just as noble  but much more practical than his caravanting father had been and he took a keen interest in all aspects of rule over the Czech lands Charles IV was not really named Charles He was named Wenceslas IV  but he had been reared at the French court and everyone there called him Charles and so the name stuck His son who succeeded him on the Czech throne was also named Wenceslas IV and this sometimes leads to some confusion When Charles IV came to power he was still very young Since hed been raised in France he didnt speak Czech Wicked advisors surrounded the young king and attempted to usurp the real rule of Bohemia while leaving young Charles IV in place as a figurehead 

Charles IV  may have been young but he was no dummy He spoke 5 languages fluently at a time when many crowned heads could not even read and write and he was a masterful diplomat He also had friends in high places  Pope Klement who was elected during Charles IVs reign had been the Czech sovereigns tutor at the court in Paris 

Young Charles IV saw through the transparent plans of the wicked advisors who surrounded him He quickly learned Czech and took over rule of his own land himself 

Charles IV was very clever very devout and very savvy He was also a lover of art and a collector of holy relics which he kept under lock and key all year long except for Easter when he paraded them through the country like a travelling circus 

The medieval Czech state reached the zenith of its power and importance Charles IV He was the King of Bohemia later also Holy Roman Emperor and today he is known as the Father of the Czech Nation 

 Charles was a very good king and he paid attention to detail It was he who made sure that the status of the Lands of the Czech Crown  the territories his father had gathered together under his rule  was legally fixed this task was made all the easier since he was Holy Roman Emperor He initiated a number of building projects in his reign especially in Prague It was at his behest that Charles Bridge and St Vitus Cathedral were built and the Hunger Wall that he commissioned remnants of which still stand today on Petrin Hill in Prague is thought to be the first worksproject in the world as he had it built to create employment for the poor and hungry masses hence the name  Charles IV personally planned Pragues New Town district where Charles Square  which is also named for him  lies Karlstejn Castle and Karlovy Vary Carlsbad are also named for Charles IV 

Many of the building projects initiated by Charles IV still stand and most are perfect examples of the Gothic style of architecture which is characterized by clean simple lines and solid structure  like the Charles Bridge and its towers the Carolinum or the OldNew Synagogue 

 Charles IV also founded Charles University the first center of higher education in all of Central Europe During his reign Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire a gilded sign on the Old Town Hall still proclaims Praga Caput Regni today and he successfully lobbied to have the Prague bishopric made an archbishopric this task was actually quite easy as the privelege was granted him by his former tutor now the Pope 

It was Charles IV too who brought the cultivation of the grape and the wine industry to the beerdrinking Czech lands That isnt to say that he neglected the beer industry  under his reign stiff prison sentences were meted out to those caught exporting cuttings of prize Czech hops  essential to the brewing of great Czech beer  abroad 

Charles IV had no fewer than four wives and any number of progeny both legitimate and il Of these his oldest legitimate son Vaclav IV was naturally chosen as his successor 

Wenceslas IV 13781419 son of Charles IV and heir to the Czech and Roman crowns was a weak and ineffective ruler He was also mean a drunk and wildly unpopular He was imprisoned twice during his reign Had times been different this may not have mattered much As luck would have it however he became king during a particularly turbulent time in Czech history 

 Unfortunately Wenceslas IV was much more interested in drinking than in ruling He was terribly spoiled and even as an adult he would throw fits when people didnt do exactly as he wished them to He is remembered by history today in two ways: sometimes as a wishy washy goodfornothing drunkard and sometimes as a benefactor of the common man The way in which this latter reputation was earned is usually explained in this way: Wenceslas IV used to go around Prague dressed as a commoner He would go to pubs and shops this way and whenever he found a merchant giving the public short measures he would punish them by having them thrown off Charles Bridge into the river to drown If this legend is based on fact then it is probably likely that Wenceslas IV pursued this hobby not so much to help the common man but rather from the pleasure he derived from having people thrown into the river 

 

Probably the most famous person Wenceslas IV had thrown into the river was an insignificant court clerk by name of John of Pomuk During the CounterReformation the Catholic Church recovered the story of John of Pomuks death and entirely overhauled it  making Johns name John of Nepomuk making his job the confessor to the Queen instead of an office clerk and making the reason for his execution the fact that John refused to divulge the Queens secrets  told in Confession  to the king John of Nepumuk was eventually made a saint on the basis of this story but the Vatican rescinded the decision in 1961 explaining that testimony of his miracles and other evidence of his deeds was fishy  

Its hard to say what the common people of the time really thought of Wenceslas IV as common people dont usually have much of a say in the writing of history It is known that he was wildly unpopular with the nobility who had him imprisoned not once but several times during his reign 

He wasnt exactly revered by his brother Sigismund either Even as the careless blood of his grandfather John of Luxembourg coursed through Vaclav IVs veins  so did the powerhungry blood of the early Przemyslide rulers flow freely through the arteries of Sigismund In short he wanted to be king and it was he who was behind at least one of the conspiracies to imprison King Vaclav IV  

While this court intrigue was going on things couldnt really have been all that good for the common man else hed not have been spending much of his leisure time listening to the rabblerousing preachers who started travelling around the country at this time full of criticism for the excesses of the Catholic Church 

One such religious reformer was to play a pivotal though posthumous role in deciding the countrys fate for the next several hundred years 

Jan Hus had been greatly influenced by the writings of John Wycliffe and he began conducting his sermons at Bethlehem Chapel in Prague in Czech rather than in Latin so that the common man could understand them He also advocated the giving of communion in both species and was critical of the church for its excessive policies  of amassing wealth selling indulgences and allowing the rich to tithe their way out of even mortal sins 

Even as these ideas were gaining popularity in the Czech lands they were becoming most wildly unpopular in other areas of the Holy Roman Empire especially the Vatican This led to the burning of Master Jan Hus at the stake at the Council at Constance on July 6 1415 when he refused to recant his words and despite that he had letter of safe conduct from Wenceslas IVs brother Sigismund 

The brutal killing of Jan Hus only served to incense and unite his followers who came to be known as the Hussites 

 The Hussites were highly critical of the abuses of the Roman Catholic Church and in the Four Articles of Prague they demanded that 1 all believers be permitted to receive Communion in both species; 2 all mortal and public sins be punished equally regardless of the sinners status 3 the Word of God be freely preached; and 4 the clergy give up their worldly wealth 

This situation culminated in 1419 with the First Defenestration of Prague in which Hussites threw 7 members of the Czech Town Council out of Pragues New Town Hall window  and to their deaths on the points of Hussiteweilded pikes below  To make the situation more interesting King Wenceslas IV had an apopleptic fit and died of a heart attack upon learning of the defenestration 

But even after the death of his brother Wenceslas IV King Sigismund of Luxembourg who also inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor never really got to be king of Bohemia The situation with the Hussites had gone too far and he spent the rest of his life fighting them in the hopes of taking control of the throne hed inherited from his brother When his initial attempts to do this met with failure he beseeched the Pope to send help 

The mighty Hussites led by the oneeyed military genius Jan Zizka defeated five waves of crusaders in a row: in 1420 1421 1422 1427 and in 1437  

Actually the fifth army of crusaders sent to battle the Hussites turned tail and fled before even catching sight of the famed warriors  because they were so terrified at hearing the refrain of the terrible Hussite battle song Ye Warriors of God It was either that or maybe just that the warriors didnt sing very well 

Well in addition to fearinspiring songs and the other tricks the Hussites had up their sleeves they also had the thing that matters most  conviction that their cause was the Just one Their symbol was the chalice and their motto Truth Prevails this motto was later used by the first President of Czechoslovakia Tomas Garrigue Masaryk as well as by a later President of Czechoslovakia Vaclav Havel  during the Velvet Revolution 

Well despite this and despite their brilliant military successes all was not well within the Hussite movement itself From the very start the Hussite movement had been divided into factions  the most prominent division was along economic lines 

A number of peasant Hussites were nothing more than hooligans at best  terrorists at worst  who joined the cause only so that they could have a good excuse to go around robbing churches and setting them aflame with Catholics inside These practices were considered to be rather in poor taste by the aristocratic Hussites Over time the movement splintered even more  even spawning an early nudist sect the Adamites The history books usually divide the Hussites into radical Taborites  named for the town of Tabor a city the Hussites founded for the occasion of the Second Coming which many considered imminent  and the moderate Utraquists  derived from the Latin sub utraque specie for their belief that communion should be given in both kinds  made up mostly of the nobility In reality though the situation on the ground just was not that simple 

This infighting came to a head at the Battle of Lipany on May 30 1434 at which the Czech Hussite factions fought among themselves This battle is considered by some to be the single most tragic event in all of Czech history 

Well the victory at the Battle of Lipany went to the moderates and this paved the way for an agreement to be reached between the Utraquist Hussites of Bohemia and the Roman Catholic Church 

The Basel Compact ceremoniously announced in 1436 permitted the Utraquist Hussites to take Communion in both kinds to have their church services conducted in the Czech language and absolved them of having to pay dues to Rome The Pope later refused to recognize the agreement but not before it had served to bring an end to the costly Hussite wars 

The extremist Taborite Hussites were not a party to this agreement and refused to accept it While the moderates stayed in the Catholic Church the extremists went underground forming their own church ordaining their own bishops pioneering public education sending out missionaries even to the 13 original American colonies and secretly printing Czechlanguage copies of the Kralice Bible  named for the town of Kralice in which it was printed This translation is still in use in the Czech lands today despite that it is often hard for modern speakers of the language to understand 

Slovakia all this while was known simply as Upper Hungary Though the Czechs and the Slovaks had been nextdoor neighbors since the time that Ancestor Cech and his brothers had come to the area they have historically had very little in common until 1918 Similarly neither country has historically ever had much to do with Poland which borders both to the north It is at this point in history  beginning in the 14th century however closer cultural contacts between Slovakia and Bohemia were formed Especially during the turbulent Hussite period of the 15th century many Hussite followers found refuge and support in the Slovak lands and some of the Slovak nobility fought on the side of the Hussites 
 

After the Compact of Basel forced King Sigismund of Luxembourg to concede to the Hussites demands the position of the regional nobility and of the towns a grouping known as the Estates was strengthened to the detriment of the centralized royal authority For some time after Sigismunds death in 1437 anarchy reigned in Bohemia 

Then after the very brief rule of Ladislav the Posthumous 14537  so named because he was born after his father had died   the Bohemian throne was occupied by the heretic King George of Podebrady 145871 George also known as the Hussite King was the first freelyelected Czech ruler He was chosen as Czech King from among the countrys nobility without regard to any previous agreements hereditary claim to the throne family connections or dynastic origin George of Podebrady won recognition throughout the Lands of the Czech Crown through his skillful diplomacy and gained the respect of all of Central Europe He also in the 15th century authored an ambitious Peace Plan for all of Europe sort of a medeival equivalent to a NATOlike organization 

But few people then as now were interested in peace and nobody subscribed to his plan On the contrary  the Hungarian monarch at this time Matthias Corvinus  with the support of the disgruntled Czech Catholic opposition who didnt like the idea of a Protestant on the throne  declared war against George of Podebrady who happened to be Matthias fatherinlaw The Hungarian campaigns against Bohemia ceased only after the death of the beloved Hussite King George of Podebrady and the ascent of Vladislav Jagellon to the throne 

CzechSlovak relations were strengthened at this time with the forming of the CzechHungarian union under the Jagellons after the death of Matthias Corvinus in 1490; and after the Kralice Bible began to be used by the Slovak Evangelical Church 

In spite of conflicts both foreign and domestic and even under the rule of the Jagellon dynastys two Catholic kings Vladislav and Ludwig religious pluralism and freedom of religion were maintained in the Czech lands with Protestants and Catholics living together in harmony All during this time of weak royal leadership the power of the nobility and towns the Estates continued to increase  even as central authority diminished 

With the death of Ludwig Jagellon he drowned in a swamp running away from the Turks at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 the shortlived CzechHungarian Union fell to pieces leaving both the Bohemian and the Hungarian thrones unoccupied 

What a window of opportunity for the Austrian Habsburgs! That Ferdinand I of Habsburg also happened to be the late Ludwig Jagellons brotherinlaw helped his claim to the Bohemain and Hungarian thrones In Bohemia the weakened central authority did too At first Ferdinand made concessions to the everpowerful Estates Soon however he began systematically to weaken the authority of the regional nobility and towns His attempts to increase the central power of the Crown naturally met with the opposition of the Estates and the whole situation culminated in an unsuccesful rebellion of the Estates in 1547 

The Estates failure was Ferdinands gain He used this victory to increase royal authority and to weaken the position of the Estates and the towns even more He also invited the Jesuits to come to the Czech lands though they never held any inquisitions here and generally did not meddle in public affairs Ostensibly fighting to maintain freedom of religion in the Czech lands against the resolutely Catholic policies of Ferdinand the Estates struggled to regain their former power and influence 

These conflicts simmered under the surface of things as the Renaissance swept through the Czech lands 

 Ferdinand was succeeded by Maxmilian II who was succeeded by Rudolf II After assuming the Austrian throne the Habsburg ruler and patron of the arts and sciences Rudolf II 15761611  moved his court from Vienna to Prague  making him the last crowned King of Bohemia to live at Prague Castle Rudolf II was a real character He had a pet lion he collected great art  including works by Da Vinci Michaelangelo and Rafael  he supported scientists such as Tycho de Brahe Johannes Kepler  as well as artists like Spranger and Von Aachen and he was a personal friend of the legendary Prague Jewish leader Rabbi Loew It is said that he also financed the work of any number of quack alchemists on his invitation John Dee and Edward Kelley spent time in Prague and that he was a little soft in the head Its possible that the Legend of Faust who lived in Prague originated at this time of scientific exploration 

 The architectural style of the time was Baroque which  like Rudolf II himself  was round and robust flamboyant and a little gaudy Baroque buildings like the Loreto and St Nicholas Church in Lesser Town Square are massive and grand The statues that top them appear so heavy that they seem likely to fall and crush innocent passersby 

 Rudolf II who suffered periods of dementia because of his acute case of syphilis was forced by his family to resign in 1611 He had been forced during his reign to concede religious freedom to the Czech Protestants and when his brother and successor Matthias tried to rescind them mounting political tensions led the Czech Estates to rebel against the Habsburgs once again 

They began their rebellion in grand Czech style with the Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 In this second defenestration two vice regents of the Austrian monarch and some governors of the Czech lands were thrown out of a tower window at Prague Castle They were not killed however as they fell onto a pile of garbage mostly straw which had accumulated in the castle moat So it can be said that they at least the nonAustrian of the throwees were the worlds first bouncing Czechs To add insult to injury or perhaps insult to insult? the Bohemian diet of the Estates then elected Frederick V of the Palatinate also known as Frederick Faltz or as the Winter King as their ruler thinking that his fatherinlaw  the English King James I  would come to their aid They could not have been more wrong 

 This rebellion of the Czech Estates was particularly unsuccessful It culminated in the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620 in which the Estates were incontrovertibly defeated by the Habsburgs They had been successful only in sparking the Thirty Years War which was to devastate much of Europe Incidentally the thenmercenary laterphilosopher Rene Descartes fought at the Battle of the White Mountain on the side of the Habsburgs 

Well the Habsburgs quite understandably did not appreciate these disturbances which were emanating from the northern reaches of their empire But the methods that they used to subdue the protestant Estates after the Battle of the White Mountain were extraordinarily harsh 

First they executed 27 nobles  leaders of the Estates who had fought on the losing side against the Habsburgs at the Battle of the White Mountain  in Pragues Old Town Square in May 1621 Some of the heads of the decapitated leaders of the rebellion were then hung strategically around Prague  for instance on the Old Town bridge tower of the Charles Bridge  to serve as an ominous reminder to the people of Who was Boss It is said that every year at the exact hour and on the exact day that they were killed the ghosts of the 27 wronglyexecuted nobles can be seen haunting the spot where they lost their heads The place today is marked by 27 crosses in the cobblestones of Old Town Square next to the Astronomical Clock The heads hung there for 11 long and lonely years before finally being taken down and given a proper burial by the Saxons who occupied Prague in 1632 in the course of the Thirty Years War 

The Thirty Years War which had begun in Prague ended there too In 1648 the Swedes had succeeded in capturing the Lesser Quarter and plundering it and Prague Castle carrying off many valuable artworks which decorate Swedish castles and palaces to this day They were defeated by a ragtag force of Czech university students and residents of Pragues Jewish town on the Charles Bridge in the last battle of the Thirty Years War It is said that the Swedes were beseeched to come by the exiled Protestant leader Comenius Jan Amos Komensky  he had wanted them to come to the aid of the bynow utterly defeated Protestant forces but by the end of the war it was already too late 

As a result of all this tumult the Czech lands lost the power to elect their own rulers and the Czech crown was made hereditary for Habsburg rulers The Habsburgs banned all religions other than Catholicism The property of Protestant members of the nobility was confiscated and handed out to loyal Catholics 

Those Czech Protestants who werent already in exile were forced to convert to Catholocism Only a very few had the courage to continue to practice their religion in secret 



The population of the country had been halved by the sundry aftermath of the Battle of the White Mountain and as fewer people also means fewer people paying tax taxes were raised 

 Things were pretty bad all around The rich got richer the poor got poorer and the economy went into a deep recession Luckily it was high time for the Enlightenment to make an entrance The administrative reforms of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II did much to alleviate the situation 

These two rulers reduced the privileges of the now allCatholic nobility who are also  perhaps to confuse us all  known as the Estates as the formerly Protestant nobility had also been called They expelled the Jesuits in 1773 and they attempted to end social oppression by abolishing serfdom in 1781 In the same year they issued the Edict of Tolerance which permitted the free exercise of religion and the secularization of education science and art Pragues Jewish town is called Josefov to this day in honor of Josef II 

The Industrial Revolution as most revolutions do started off small at the end of the 18th century and then really picked up steam  so to speak  in the 19th century It was to have a monumental impact on the Czech lands 

The first factories in the Austrian Empire were built in the mountainous border regions of the Czech lands where there was no shortage of water power from rushing streams and rivers to run them While it did not take long for steam power to be harnessed the industrial boundaries had been drawn and these regions remain predominantly industrial to this day 

Railway lines were laid in the Czech lands by Jan Perner  who met his death when he hit his head against a pole while leaning out of the window of a moving train  an activity which has been forbidden in this country since the Czech railway pioneers tragic accident  Trams mostly constructed by the Czech Thomas Edison Frantisek Krizik began to carry people around on their errands in and between major towns in those days tram lines connected the cities of Bratislava Budapest and Vienna to each other  about a onehour ride It was at this time too that Gregor Mendel  was conducting his famous experiments on hereditary with peas in a monastery in Moravia and that Jan Evangelista Purkyne peered into his microscope one day to discover a cell looking back at him he was the first person to recognize it as such 

 The major architectural styles of the time were Classicist and Empire both of which used classical Greek and Roman motifs in a balanced and simple design Two buildings which are closely associated with Mozarts stay in Prague in the late 18th century are excellent examples of these styles: the Estates Theatre in which Mozart conducted the premier of Don Giovanni is Classicist and the Bertramka villa where he stayed with the Dusek family is one of the purest examples of Empire that exists in the Czech Republic But we digress 

 Industrialization was not the only big change taking place in the Austrian Empire at this time The Czech nation like most of the others under Austrian rule was also going through political and cultural changes leading to demands for greater autonomy and self determination for the different nations under Austrian rule 

In this country the push for autonomy was known as the Czech National Revival movement Narodni obrozeni The dominant political leaders of the movement  Frantisek Palacky Frantisek Ladislav Rieger and Karel Havlicek Borovsky  were liberals This meant that they wanted reforms within the Austrian monarchy but did not want independence for the Czech lands This brought them into conflict with the democrats who were republican and fiercely antiMonarchy 

But the Czech National Revival movement almost had more to do with culture than with politics Frantisek Palacky and Karel Havlicek Borovsky who are mentioned above for their political efforts were both writers Czech Literature enjoyed a Golden Age during the Czech National Revival as the Czech language  which had all but died out under Habsburg rule  was rediscovered Other notable writers of the time include Bozena Nemcova Karel Hynek Macha who published the epic lyrical poem Maj then died of pneumonia he caught while fighting a fire one month before he was to be married and Josef Jungmann  who put together the first modern Czech dictionary 

Many popular books retelling the old Czech legends of Libuse and Sarka and Bivoj and Bruncvik were published at this time and some of the leaders of the Czech National Revival even falsified ancient 13th century texts of these legends which they claimed to have found in a cave somewhere Perhaps the only authority in the movement who publicly denied the authenticity of the texts was a young university professor by name of Tomas Garrigue Masaryk and he was passionately detested by the other leaders for doing so  

But we digress yet again France had its infamous revolution in 1848 In the same year in the Czech lands the feudal system was abolished leading to waves of emigration much of it to the New World  particularly to the United States In June 1848 a PanSlavic Congress convened in Prague to consider possible ways of convincing the Habsburgs to transform their empire into a federative state of equal nations something like a United States of Austria Suddenly the discussions were interrupted by an aimless rebellion inspired by the French Revolution and including dramatic baracades in the streets which was led by bored students and the most radical of the radical democrats 

The rebellion was effortlessly put down by the local Austrian leader Prince Windischgratz  who declared martial law and on June 16 1848 even bombarded Prague from Petrin Hill In this way both the revolt and the PanSlavic congress both came to a premature end leaving the question of the future shape of the Austrian Empire utterly unresolved In a strange aside to this episode Prince Windischgratzs wife lost her life in all this commotion  shot through a window while she was in her apartment To this day nobody knows who did the shooting or why 

Scared by both the French Revolution and the summer rebellion in Prague Austria introduced something akin to martial law in the whole of the Empire to discourage republican efforts at independence Autonomy movements throughout the Austrian Empire were suppressed But as revolutionary movements have a tendency of doing this one did not die down; it just sat around simmering below the ostensibly calm surface of things Tensions did not decrease On the contrary 

The Austrian Empire of the time was massive and contained the territories of many modernday countries Most of these nationalities were clamoring for autonomy 

In the 1860s this pressure led the Habsburgs to transform the Austrian Empire into the dualist AustroHungarian constitutional monarchy This was just hunkeydorey by the Hungarians but was not exactly appreciated by most of the other ethnic nations within what was now the AustroHungarian Empire 

The Czechs were united in their opposition to the new dual system but they were divided among themselves as to what they wanted to do about it These divisions grew deeper as the 19th century progressed 

There were a number of rival political factions: the Czech National Party split into two camps: the conservative Old Czechs and the liberal Young Czechs; the Czech Social Democratic Party founded in 1878; the progressives who favored the policies of Tomas Masaryk; the Agrarian party; the Christian Socialists; the National Socialists; and the Radical Progressives 

The majority of the Czech political parties supported a program calling for the restoration of the Czech state in its historical borders  but within the framework of the Austrian Empire Again each party had a different idea of exactly how this goal should be accomplished 

The turn of the 19th and 20th centuries was characterized by growing economic and political freedom for the Czechs and by outstanding acheivements on the part of Czechs in culture medicine and science Architectural trends at the end of the century were romantic copies of past styles like NeoGothic These romantic enthusiasts sometimes did more harm than good as in the case of the reconstruction of Karlstejn Castle It is because of this illfated reconstruction that Karlstejn does not qualify for the UNESCO World Heritage list today In other cases they just did silly things like build fake ancient ruins in Prague parks perhaps to go along with their ancient legend texts The Czech writers and artists Jan Neruda Alois Jirasek Mikulas Ales Bedrich Smetana Antonin Dvorak  Alfons Mucha and Frantisek Bilek all lived and worked at this time The National Theater National Museum and Rudolfinum were built at the turn of the century and the first films in the Czech Republic were made in 1898 

The battle for universal suffrage within the AustroHungarian state was won in 1907 All men in the Czech lands regardless of economic status could vote  women in the Czech lands did not get the vote until 1919 But most of the rest of the political advances made by the Czechs came into being in a sort of fuzzy grey area The constitutional status of the Czech lands within the framework of the Monarchy remained an open and  in Prague at least  a muchdebated question 

Well while Czech nationalists were busy sitting in pubs drinking beer and debating how best to effect the changes they wanted to see implemented in the AustroHungarian government members of other nations within the Empire were also pressing for reforms and for independence It was these pressures that led Serbian nationalist Gavrillo Princip to assassinate the Archduke Francis Ferdinand the heir to the Austrian throne on June 28 1914 precipitating World War I Princip was locked up for this deed and spent the rest of his days at the prison in Terezin Fortress in the Czech lands 

During the course of World War I the Czechs became unified in their opposition to Austrian rule 

Most especially AustriaHungarys alignment with Germany and the restriction of democratic rights in the Czech lands led to growing opposition to the monarchy here An organized resistance began to develop both at home and abroad 

 The Czech university professor philosopher and politician Tomas Garrigue Masaryk the same one who doubted the authenticity of the faked manuscripts and the one who was later to become Czechoslovakias first president had been an advocate of more independence for the Czech lands long before the war had even started In December of 1914 he went abroad where he continued to fight for Czechoslovak independence throughout the war He worked closely with Czech lawyer Edvard Benes and Slovak astronomer Milan Rastislav Stefanik who were also in exile in the United States throughout the conflict It was in the United States at this time that Masaryk met his wife American Charlotte Garrigue 

It was there too that Masaryk Benes and Stefanik founded the Czech National Council in 1916 Over time this organization was renamed the Czechoslovak National Council and was recognized as the valid voice of Czechoslovakia by Allied leaders Their position as the leaders of free Czechoslovakia was further strengthened with the formation of Czechoslovak military units known as the Czechoslovak Legions which fought alongside the Allies The Czechoslovak Legions earned particular distinction on the Italian French and Russian fronts  and on the last of these they actually became involved in the Russian Revolution fighting against the Bolsheviks and for a time during that revolution controlled about half of the territory of Czarist Russia 

Resistance at home grew only gradually At first it was limited to small spy groups who had contact with Masaryk who was considered an enemy of Austria on account of his subversive activities Active resistance to the monarchy was severely punished and as a result many prominent Czech cultural and political personalities spent most of the war behind bars convicted of treason While the sentence for treason at that time was actually death the Austrians were too busy to carry out the sentences Thus the executions were never carried out and these Czech leaders simply languished in jail for the duration 

By 1917 when things were quite apparantly not in AustriaHungarys favor Czech opposition to the war became much more active People began organizing strikes demonstrations and even violent protests  which had to be put down by the army Anybody who is particularly interested in this period of Czech history should definitely read The Good Soldier Schwiek by Jaroslav Hasek It not only offers a great deal of insight into the kind of passive resistance the Czechs favor but also offers many more insights into the Czech psyche 

In May 1918 the representatives of the resistance movement abroad had signed the Pittsburgh Convention which approved the formation of a joint state composed of Slovakia and the Czech lands Later  much later very recently in fact  Slovak politicians seeking autonomy for Slovakia would refer to a provision in this agreement mentioning Slovakias own administration parliament and courts of law 

While the resistance leaders abroad were planning a new state the various and sundry political forces in the Czech lands still could not agree on whether they wanted to radically reconstruct or completely abolish the political structure of AustriaHungary In July 1918 the Czech National Committee a grouping of the leaders of the chief political parties which wasnt much cooperating with Masaryks efforts in exile was reorganized and began preparing to assume power once the Central Powers were defeated 

 In October 1918 Masaryk Benes and Stefanik obtained recognition of the Czechoslovak National Council as the interim government of the Czechoslovak Republic from the Allied Powers But while they were in Switzerland with delegates from the Prague National Committee discussing details of setting up this new state a hastilyorganized third grouping the National Committee headed by Antonin Svehla Alois Rasin Jiri Stribrny Frantisek Soukup and Vavro Srobar proclaimed Czechoslovakia an independent Republic on October 28 1918 and began to assume the transfer of power from Austrian officials 

Adding to this disparity and completely independent of events in Prague Slovak political representatives issued the Martin Declaration in favor of a joint Czechoslovak state on October 30 1918 

On November 14 1918 the interim Parliament declared that the new Czechoslovak state would be a republic and named Tomas Garrigue Masaryk as the first President 

The Czechoslovak Republic CSR was composed of the historical Czech lands of Bohemia Moravia and Silesia as well as Slovakia and Ruthenia SubCarpathian Russia 

Czechoslovakias relations with its neighboring states  Germany Hungary and Poland  were complicated from the very start 

In security matters Czechoslovakia alligned itself with France and her partners in the Little Entente As Germany grew more threatening in the course of the 1930s Czechoslovakia also signed a pact with the Soviet Union which promised to help Czechoslovakia in the case of need  but provided that France fulfilled her obligations to help the nation first 

The Czechs and the Slovaks  who had used nationalistic arguments to justify their drive for independence from AustriaHungary  now found themselves at the other end of the bargaining table While these two nations were officially considered the two partners in the Czechoslovak union together they comprised less than 65 percent of the total population More than 3 million Germans  some 23 percent of the population  lived mostly in the Czech border regions the territories which were to become known as the Sudetenland Meanwhile the Tesin region in the north was inhabited by a Polish minority of 75000; South Slovakia and Ruthenia had a large Hungarian minority of about 745000; and most of the population of Ruthenia something less than half a million people were quite naturally Ruthenians 

After World War I ethnic Germans in the border regions made a halfhearted attempt to secede from Czechoslovakia which was put down by the Czechoslovak army in 1918 Over the course of the next 20 years the two largest German political parties  the Agrarians and the Christian Socialists  were won over by the Czechoslovak government and agreed to cooperate with the Czechoslovak state 

Czechoslovakia was one of the few states in Europe between the two World Wars with a genuine parliamentary democracy guaranteed by the Constitution of February 1920 Even the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia which had been established in 1921 was allowed to legally exist  which was very unusual for the time The Communists even had a few members in parliament  and they were allowed to remain there even when they started to openly denounce democracy as such  and especially the democratic system in Czechoslovakia 

After dealing with postwar chaos and putting down a few radical Bolshevist uprisings the domestic political and economic situation in Czechoslovakia was basically stabilized by the beginning of the 1920s 

In the 20 years between the two World Wars Czechoslovakia was one of the worlds most advanced industrialagrarian countries In fact it was among the 10 richest nations in the world at that time as it had inherited virtually all of Austrias industrial base This early stability paved the way for a flowering of Czech literature and culture Proud of their new independence Czechoslovaks were anxious to put their new country on the map  sometimes in the craziest ways This led Czech Radio for instance to start broadcasting in 1923  despite that they didnt have a transmitter or even a microphone  They simply borrowed the former as well as a tent to protect them from the elements from the Czechoslovak Boy Scouts and manufactured the latter from a telephone receiver Why the rush? They were anxious to be the first country in Central Europe to begin regular radio broadcaste Of course a Czech  by name of Frantisek Behounek  took part in the 1928 multinational attempt to reach the North Pole in a zeppelin  and was one of the survivors to be rescued after the good airship Italia crashed discouragingly far from its destination 

Experiments with architecture in interwar Czechoslovakia resulted in Prague today having the only Cubist buildings in the world like The House at the Black Madonna which houses a museum of Czech cubist art today and a number of houses along the embankment under Vysehrad on Rasinovo nabrezi and on Neklanova Street Franz Kafka Josef Capek and his brother Karel the two coined the word robot together Jaroslav Hasek Emil Filla Max Svabinsky Otto Gutfreund Vaclav Spala all lived and worked at this time 

At the end of the twenties and the beginning of the thirties the Czechoslovak economy was hit hard by the world economic crisis with disastrous social and political consequences: 13 million people were unemployed Hardest hit were the soontobeknownasSudeten border regions where German inhabitants predominated 

The economic crisis and the growing influence of the Nazi movement in Germany served to politicize the ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia On Hitlers orders they called first for autonomy then for secession from the Czechoslovak state In the 1935 elections both of the traditional German parties the Agrarians and the Christian Socialists experienced a monumental decline in voter support in favor of the Sudeten German Party The Sudeten German Party with 152 percent of the vote became the largest Germaninterest political party in the Republic 

Tomas Garrigue Masaryk resigned from office in 1935 due to illness and was succeeded by Edvard Benes Benes a National Socialist had the misfortune to be a weak and ineffectual ruler during a particular turbulent time in the nations history  much as the king Wenceslas IV had been in the Hussite period centuries before 

A PE teacher named Konrad Henlein was the leader of the Sudeten German Party and he gradually became the mouthpiece of Nazi Germany in Czechoslovakia His was a separatist platform aimed at joining the Czech border lands to Germany 

Nothing less than Czechoslovakias sovereignty was at stake But this did not interest many people outside of the small Czechoslovak state 

France and Britain favored a policy of appeasement in response to Hitlers aggressive policy towards Czechoslovakia and so Konrad Heinleins wish came true in September 1938  when the four great powers of the time Germany Great Britain France and Italy decided at a meeting in Munich that extensive areas of the Czech border regions were to be ceded to Germany 

Shortly after the Munich Pact was signed the Czech border regions were indeed joined with Germany Seizing this window of opportunity Poland snapped up the Tesin region in the north and Hungary annexed the southern part of Slovakia while Hungary captured Ruthenia Overnight Czechoslovakia lost about a third of its territory
